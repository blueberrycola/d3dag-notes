<p>In mathematics a DAG is a directed graph with NO DIRECTED CYCLES<br>
A directed cycle is a graph that has all edges connecting to one direction ie octagon.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_ordering" title="Topological ordering">topological ordering</a> of a directed graph is an ordering of its vertices into a sequence, such that for every edge the start vertex of the edge occurs earlier in the sequence than the ending vertex of the edge. A graph that has a topological ordering cannot have any cycles, because the edge into the earliest vertex of a cycle would have to be oriented the wrong way. Therefore, every graph with a topological ordering is acyclic</p>

<p>Any undirected graph may be made into a DAG by choosing a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order" title="Total order">total order</a>  for its vertices and directing every edge from the earlier endpoint in the order to the later endpoint. The resulting  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(graph_theory)" title="Orientation (graph theory)">orientation</a>  of the edges is called an  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acyclic_orientation" title="Acyclic orientation">acyclic orientation</a>.</p>
<p>Any directed graph may be made into a DAG by removing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_vertex_set" title="Feedback vertex set">feedback vertex set</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_arc_set" title="Feedback arc set">feedback arc set</a>, a set of vertices or edges (respectively) that touches all cycles.</p>
